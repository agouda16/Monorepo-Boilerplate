# ðŸ§  Server - Node.js + TypeScript (Clean Architecture)

This is the backend of the boilerplate, built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**, following the principles of **Clean Architecture**.

## ðŸ§± Clean Architecture Overview
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/ # Compiled output
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ config/ # Environment config, DB setup
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ domain/ # Entities and business rules (pure logic)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ use-cases/ # Application-specific business rules
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/ # External services (e.g., DB, APIs)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ interfaces/ # Controllers, routes, middlewares
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ controllers/ # Express route handlers
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ index.ts # Entry point that runs the server

This structure promotes **separation of concerns** and is easy to test and maintain.
